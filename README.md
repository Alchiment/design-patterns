# Design patterns
The purpose of this repo is to bring a way of implementing the concepts of Design patterns in JavaScript code together with Angular and React frameworks.

## Guidance on folders
```
- README.md
- design-patterns/
-- Here we sill see examples in JavaScript code separated through multiple files .js
- angular-design-patterns/
-- Here we will see an Angular project and split each use case into components.
- react-design-patterns/
-- As well as Angular implementation, we will see a React project and split each use case into components.
```

## Code execution
**design-patterns** folder should be run with NodeJS console.

*Example:* ``` > node ./design-patterns/single-resposibility.js```

*Output: It should print a table in the console or any other result.*
